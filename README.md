#  Hi there 👋 I'm Joe

## 👨‍🎓 About Me
I'm a **Controls Systems Technician** and a **Computer Engineering student** at **Wright State University**. I’m a hands-on problem solver who loves diving into challenge and learning new things. When I’m not working on projects, I love exploring new technology, hiking, and learning new skills.

## 🛠 I'm currently working on

### 🐦 Raspberry Pi Infrared Bird Box
Inspired by my mom's passion for birds, this project involves setting up a bird box for her backyard. Using Raspberry Pi and infrared technology, I'll create a video streaming system to observe the birds nesting inside. This project combines electronics, programming, and my love for nature.

### 🌡️ Raspberr Pi Flood/Water Presence Sensor
This project leverages Raspberry Pi and flood/water sensors to monitor the conditions in my basement. It will use PrivateEyePi to send email alerts if it detects a leak.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- Ubuntu and PowerShell
- Git
- Python

Through these projects, I'm learning more about IoT systems and using Linux that I'm currently learning at Wright State! (shoutout to my Instructor [Kayleigh Duncan](https://github.com/pattonsgirl))
